### React Pirate Rrrr(React, Reflux & React-Router)

### What is React Pirate
React Pirate is a boilerplate/starter kit for React/Flux Single Page Apps.  It provides a starting point that follows conventions and best practices recommended by production applications.

### Architecture

This application uses reflux for data flow which is a simplified version of the flux architecture.  The main difference being that the dispatcher being moved into the actions themselves with singleton implementations removed. This article [Deconstructing ReactjJS's Flux](http://spoike.ghost.io/deconstructing-reactjss-flux/) gives a great overview of the differences between a traditional flux implementation and reflux
